A small program that lets the user encrypt or decrypt text into 2 different ciphers. 
You choose if you want to encrypt or decrypt (or exit the program) before choosing which cipher you want to have en/decrypted.
When you are finished the program will take you back to the main menu and let you 

Modularization
CLI:
The program uses a simple command-line interface where the user selects actions and enters text and key via the terminal.
Caesar:
The Caesar functions are separated into individual functions for encryption and decryption, making the code clear and reusable.
Vigenère:
Vigenère encryption and decryption are also divided into separate functions, and key handling is modularized so the key can be reused regardless of text length.

I did not understand the part about doxygen and did not find the text in the program for week 5 very useful.
